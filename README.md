# BlackJack Game
***
Blackjack game is a classic casino game of luck and strategy. It is the most popular and most playing casino game in the entire world and is also known as twenty one. <br />
The goal of blackjack is simple - to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, and to have a higher hand than the dealer. 
If the dealer goes over 21, they bust and lose the game. The same goes for you.
Here the dealer is the computer itself. 

# Basic Rules To Remember
***
Each card in the deck is valued as follows. <br />
* An ace can be valued at either 1 or 11.
* All cards from 2-10 are valued at their face value.
* All picture cards (jack, queen and king) are valued at 10.
* Suits are irrelevant.

<br />

Once the dealer has reached 17 or gone bust there is no more action. Bets are then settled on the following basis. <br />
* A player wins an amount equal to their stake if they avoid going bust and have a higher valued hand than the dealer.
* A player wins an amount equal to their stake if they avoid going bust and the dealer does go bust.
* A player is paid out at 3:2 if they are dealt a blackjack (any card valued at 10 plus an ace), and the dealer does not have a blackjack.
* A player loses their stake if they go bust, regardless of the dealer’s hand.
* A player loses their stake if the value of their hand is lower than the value of the dealer’s hand.
* A player’s stake is returned if the value of their hand is the same as the value of the dealer’s hand.
* A player’s stake is returned if they and the dealer are both dealt a blackjack.

# General Info
***
Step 1 - Decide whether to Hit or Stand <br />
Work out the value of your hand, as well as that of the dealer, to get as close as possible to 21 without going bust by pressing the 'Hit' button.

Step 2 - Your Hand Value <br />
As a result of the move you just made, you’ll probably have a new hand value. 
You'll remain in the game if your hand is valued at 21 or anything less. Once done, press the 'Stand' button. Now the chance goes to the dealer. 

Step 3 - Dealer Reveals Their Cards <br />
Once you hit the 'Stand' button, the dealer reveals their cards. 

Step 4 - See Who is Closer to 21 <br />
If your hand is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, you bust the dealer and win. If the dealer has 21 or a closer score to 21 than any of the other players, the dealer wins.
